        Leaf spots are brown in color, circular and enlarge to about the size of a nickel.
        Concentric rings can be seen within the spots and these may coalesce forming irregular areas on the foliage.
        Disease severity is positively correlated with cloudy, wet weather.
        The disease occurs primarily on mature leaves often beginning on the lower leaves and progressing to other leaves
        higher up on the stalk.
